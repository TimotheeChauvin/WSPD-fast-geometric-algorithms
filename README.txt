The Main class builds and prints an octree and a WSPD corresponding to a small amount of points. It can be executed on its own, without any argument.
To test the "closest pair" and "diameter" tasks with input point cloud xyz.off, execute PointCloudViewer with argument FULLPATH/xyz.off. 
To test graph layouts with input network xyz.mtx and display the network, execute NetworkLayout with argument FULLPATH/xyz.mtx. 
To test graph layouts (15 iterations of the force directed layout algorithms, with and without WSPD) with input network xyz.mtx without displaying the network, execute GraphDrawingResults with argument FULLPATH/xyz.mtx.
